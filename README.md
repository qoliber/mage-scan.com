# So You Think You Can Improve Mage-Scan.com?

Welcome to the official suggestion box / therapy couch for [mage-scan.com](https://mage-scan.com). Our ridiculously ambitious goal is to build the best, most brutally honest Magento, MageOS, and Adobe Commerce scanner on the planet. This repository is where you come in.

## What is Mage-Scan.com?

It's a free tool that puts Magento, MageOS, and Adobe Commerce sites under the microscope, hunting for performance bottlenecks and questionable life choices in their implementation. Think of it as a friendly (mostly) robot that helps store owners, devs, and agencies sleep a little better at night.

## How Mage-Scan.com Works?

Curious about the wizardry behind the curtain? It's less magic, more duct tape and hope. We have a slick Next.js frontend that you see, and a hard-working Node.js application that functions as the API, doing all the crazy scanning in the background. This Node.js scanner is built on a simple queue system: first come, first served. All sites are scanned in the order they arrive.

And yes, we're painfully aware that the scanner tends to fall over after about 100 websites, thanks to what we suspect is a pesky JavaScript memory leak in Node.js. We'll either fix it eventually... or just throw more memory at the server and hope for the best. TBD.

## The Goal of This Repository

Look, we have some ideas, but we're pretty sure the collective genius (and madness) of the Magento community is smarter than we are. This is our official cauldron for brewing up better, more accurate, and more useful scans. Your brain is the secret ingredient. Don't be shy.

## How to Contribute

*   **Got a brilliant idea?** Or did our scanner tell you something utterly bonkers? [Open an issue](https://github.com/qoliber/mage-scan.com/issues). Let it all out.
*   **Feeling philosophical?** Want to debate the finer points of Varnish configs or just have a thought that isn't quite an "issue"? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/qoliber/mage-scan.com/discussions).
*   **Spotted a typo in this README?** Wow, you're thorough. Feel free to submit a pull request and show us up.

## What We're Looking For

We're hungry for your thoughts on:

*   **New Scans:** What dark corners of a Magento install are we not peering into yet?
*   **Smarter Scans:** How can we make our existing checks less wrong and more "aha!"?
*   **Prettier Results:** How do we make the medicine (our report) go down a little smoother?
*   **Scanner Hallucinations:** Did we flag something that's perfectly fine? Or miss a glaring issue? Tell us!

Seriously, no idea is too small or too weird.

## Why the code is not open source... yet?

Ah, the eternal question. We picked Node.js and Next.js mostly because we were curious and maybe a little reckless. It was a "let's learn this thing" kind of project. So, while we love open source, we're not ready to expose our questionable coding habits to the world just yet. Plus, once we start adding super-secret security checks, we can't just leave the playbook lying around for the bad guys, can we? The scoring logic, however, is an open book.

## An Invitation for Trusted Partners

> **Want a peek behind the curtain?** We might just let you. We're open to sharing the codebase with trusted partners once we escape the beta dimension. Who's a "trusted partner"? A top-tier agency or dev with serious Magento street cred. We're looking for the truly committed, the kind of crazy people who find solace in a terminal window at 2 AM because sleep is for the weak. If that's you, get in touch. Just know that since this is an "after-hours" passion project, our release schedule is... let's call it "artisanal."

## The Final Goal: Our Grand, Delusional Plan

Our ultimate, coffee-fueled dream is to use AI agents and automation to spin up full-blown, universal case studies for every site we scan. We're talking about a deep, narrative analysis that goes way beyond a simple score. It's ambitious. It's probably a little nuts. We're planning to actually start this madness around October 2025. Wish us luck.
